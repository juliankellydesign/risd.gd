    Rich, multifaceted and encompassing a
    broad range of media, Graphic Design at
    RISD respects the foundations of formal,
    aesthetic and analytical knowledge and
    skills while exploring the ever-changing
    context and function of visual
    communication. In the studio students
    learn the fundamental value of
    typography, imagery, grids, systems and
    more in the course of creating
    everything from traditional books,
    posters, logos and websites to apps,
    interactive texts and other digital
    media.TK
