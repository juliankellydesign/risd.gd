      title: Print on Paper
      description: '1:10–6:10pm / Jan Fairbairn (new!) This class foregrounds tactility—the sense most unique to printed objects. The course covers advanced concepts in use of color, form, layout and pagination to create more intimately produced printed objects. Projects will be student-driven, resulting in a range of hand-produced zines, posters, booklets, posters, prints, paper sculptures, masks and other concrete forms.   Readings, contemporary issues and class discussions will spark themes that encourage students to generate their own content that finds its form into small editioned works.  This course will encourage experimentation, collaboration and visual storytelling. Students will be given an overview of Risograph printing. '

      title: Programming Foundations
      description: '1:10–6:10pm / Chris Novello (new! to be listed ~ May 10 ) / Draft description: <p>The first goal of the course is to nurture foundations in programmatic thinking. </p>  <p>You’ll learn to code. You will develop agility with fundamental programmatic primitives like: functions, loops, variables, conditional logic, recursion, & data structures. We’ll journey across a number of programming paradigms and techniques: imperative, declarative, objects & messaging, functional & code-as-data, asynchronous & event-driven, etc. You’ll make realtime multiplayer software via websockets, and query popular network services by learning http & REST basics. Begin to gain a programmer’s command of your own machine, understanding the terminal and command line tools. Our targets will be the browser and node.js, so we’ll work in Javascript and languages with a good WASM story.</p>  <p>The second goal of the class is to destroy computation.</P>  <p>Come to question everything in the course. Wonder if code is the right notation / instrument for composing computer media. Recognize a drastic literacy asymmetry in the world. See the hazards of “UI/UX” culture, hazards of how civilization currently regards computation. Consider how client-server relates to governance & truth, and how utopian rhetorics of decentralization could summon new kinds of problems for society. Understand machine-learning as painting. What are new software attitudes? How do we incubate new voices in computation? </P>  <p>No background with code required. Open to majors, non-majors, graduate students. Fine artists strongly encouraged. </p>'

      title: 'Wkshp: Motion Graphics'
      description: >
        1:10–6:10pm / Weixi Zeng (new) This
        workshop will serve as an introduction
        to motion graphics — an increasingly
        essential addition to the graphic design
        toolkit. We will jump right into
        developing a professional workflow for
        After Effects, plus learning how it
        works in unison with programs like
        Illustrator and Photoshop. Through a
        series of in-class demos, quick motion
        sketches, and a larger scale project,
        students will acquire and understand
        various techniques to animate. This
        workshop will also touch on principles
        of graphic design and typography,
        especially the many ways motion can be
        used to elevate them. In addition,
        students will learn to observe and pay
        attention to details, understand how
        timing and pacing work in storytelling,
        and potentially open a door for further
        inquiry into motion graphics as an
        integral part to their artistic
        practice. (No prior experience with
        After Effects required, must be
        proficient in Adobe Illustrator and
        Photoshop.)

      title: 'Wkshp: JavaScript Libraries'
      description: >
        1:10–6:10pm / Bobby Joe Smith (new) As
        a programming language, JavaScript
        provides tremendous potential for
        artistic expression. Built on top of the
        language are powerful libraries that
        make it easier for programmers to
        transform their websites into platforms
        for a wide range of applications, such
        as, interactive 3D models, responsive
        scalable vector graphics, virtual
        reality, creative computation, physical
        computing, spatial audio, desktop
        applications, and more! In this workshop
        students will be introduced to a variety
        of front-end libraries that will open up
        new avenues for their work on the web.
        The aim of this workshop is to provide a
        positive and supportive learning
        environment for students to experiment
        with contemporary front-end libraries,
        grow their web programming skills, and
        explore the web as a medium for creative
        expression. Readings, projects, and
        exercises will encourage critical
        thinking about the web as a space for a
        creative practice and prompt students to
        design new possibilities for the
        internet.
