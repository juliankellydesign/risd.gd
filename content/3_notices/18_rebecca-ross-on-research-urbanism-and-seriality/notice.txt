She will share her projects (link: http://www.urbanpamphleteer.org/ text: Urban Pamphleteer) and (link: http://www.londonischanging.org/ text: London is Changing) that both engaged community participation and resulted in scholarly and graphic production via print, web, and environment. Ross will reflect on the significance and outcomes of these projects, and of the CSM MA program, as valuable models of an academic practice with graphic design research at its core.
