Title: ☯ Hangul 한글 Workshop 워크숍 ☯

----

Text: Find out why Hangul, the Korean alphabet, is considered to be one of the most elegant writing systems in the world. June Shin will lead a part-lecture, part-lettering workshop in the GD Commons. Open to anyone interested. Familiarity with Hangul not required. Love of form absolutely required. First come, first serve, as the space permits. Bring a roll of masking tape and some square-tip markers (plus any mark-making tools of your choice—ink, paint, brush, etc.—if you want).
