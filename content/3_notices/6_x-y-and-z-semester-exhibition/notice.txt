----

Text: 

Come to the opening of the X, Y, and Z: Graphic Design in Space exhibition of work by students in James Goggin’s elective class. Projects this semester analysed the act of reading, critiqued the value of universal standards, wondered what communication with extraterrestrials might teach us about communication with human beings, and transformed empty/underused/overlooked spaces in and around Providence.

One day only! Act now! Review with guest critics 1:10–5:30pm, exhibition opening 6pm.
