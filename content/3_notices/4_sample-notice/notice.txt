Text: 

Show the world what’s happening here. @risd_gd has publicly viewable Instagram and twitter accounts. The aim for the platforms is to share what’s happening within the Department with current, former and future community members. Instagram is faculty and student-run, relying on weekly guest editors to post and repost content using their point of view of the Department.

Read our guidelines below and sign up to take over the account. This is an open call. Any GD student or faculty member can sign up.
