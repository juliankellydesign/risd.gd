Text: 

Anther Kiley will give a short visual review of typesetting nuts and bolts, addressed to his Graduate Type 2 class, but open to anyone interested. The presentation will survey rules, conventions and opinions aggregated from various articles of typographic gospel including Robert Bringhurst’s Elements of Typographic Style and Lucy Hitchcock’s “Finer Points of Typography” lecture, as well as from Anther’s own experience and prior teaching.

Talk will start on time… don’t be late!
