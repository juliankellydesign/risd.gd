    RISD GD supports the fringe, the
    nascent, and the highly evolved in order
    to affect visual culture. We treat the
    educational environment as a thriving
    ecosystem that leads to change, not to
    reaffirm the status quo.

    Graphic Design graduates leave RISD
    prepared to work in almost any field
    imaginable — from education to film,
    television, publishing, retail and more.
    Alumni follow a wide range of individual
    paths, including running their own
    design studios, working for large
    corporations, specializing in web and
    interactive media, and creating
    everything from package design to title
    sequences for film and television.TK

  text2: >
    Rich, multifaceted and encompassing a
    broad range of media, Graphic Design at
    RISD respects the foundations of formal,
    aesthetic and analytical knowledge and
    skills while exploring the ever-changing
    context and function of visual
    communication. In the studio students
    learn the fundamental value of
    typography, imagery, grids, systems and
    more in the course of creating
    everything from traditional books,
    posters, logos and websites to apps,
    interactive texts and other digital
    media.TK
