    RISD Graphic Design runs a three-year
    BFA program with about 65 students per
    class and a two and three-year MFA
    program graduating about 16 per class.
    Twelve full-time faculty and about 30
    additional adjunct faculty teach about
    110 courses per year. We accept transfer
    students to the BFA program and have
    studio space for juniors and seniors.
